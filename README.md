# Project (1):
# COVID-19 Data Analytics using SQL
This project presents an analytical study of global COVID-19 data using SQL. By building and querying a structured dataset, we derive key insights about confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, active cases, growth rates, and trends.

# Objective
To perform in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL queries and generate meaningful insights, trends, and summaries on a country-wise and day-wise basis.

# Tools Used
MySQL / SQL Workbench

SQL DDL and DML Queries

Views & CTEs

Aggregations & Window Functions

# Features & Insights
Total confirmed, recovered, death, and active cases per country.

Daily new case calculations and rolling averages.

Country-wise recovery and death rates.

Top countries per day by confirmed cases.

Views for daily and country-wise summaries.

Growth rate of confirmed cases by country.

# Structure
Table creation and sample data insertion

Complex queries using JOIN, GROUP BY, CTE, ROW_NUMBER, WINDOW FUNCTIONS

View creation for reusable summaries

# Outcome
The project successfully tracks COVID-19 trends and identifies key metrics that help in understanding how the virus spread across nations over time.

# Key Highlights
Real-time tracking logic

Data insights over multiple days

Clean architecture with views and reusable queries

# Project (2);
# Hospital Management System – SQL Database Project
This project focuses on building and querying a structured Hospital Management System using SQL. It includes comprehensive tables for departments, doctors, patients, visits, billing, medications, and prescriptions to simulate a real-world hospital scenario.

# Objective
To create a normalized SQL-based hospital database and derive insights through SQL queries such as patient history, billing, visit tracking, and prescription analysis.

# Tools Used
MySQL / SQL Workbench

SQL DDL & DML

Foreign Key Constraints

Aggregations & Joins

# Features
Doctor and department linkage

Complete patient visit & treatment history

Real-time billing and payment tracking

Medication prescription records

Analytical queries for admin insights

# Structure
Departments – hospital units (e.g., Cardiology)

Doctors – staff details

Patients – individual records

Visits – consultations & diagnosis

Bills – payment tracking

Medications & Prescriptions – treatment linkage

# Outcome
The system enables effective management of hospital operations, simplifies record maintenance, and provides analytical capabilities for better decision-making.

# Key Insights
Visit trends per doctor

Total billing per department

Pending payments and payment modes

Commonly prescribed medications
