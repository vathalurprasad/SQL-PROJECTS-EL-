# Project (1):
# COVID-19 Data Analytics using SQL
This project presents an analytical study of global COVID-19 data using SQL. By building and querying a structured dataset, we derive key insights about confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, active cases, growth rates, and trends.

# Objective
To perform in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL queries and generate meaningful insights, trends, and summaries on a country-wise and day-wise basis.

# Tools Used
MySQL / SQL Workbench

SQL DDL and DML Queries

Views & CTEs

Aggregations & Window Functions

# Features & Insights
Total confirmed, recovered, death, and active cases per country.

Daily new case calculations and rolling averages.

Country-wise recovery and death rates.

Top countries per day by confirmed cases.

Views for daily and country-wise summaries.

Growth rate of confirmed cases by country.

# Structure
Table creation and sample data insertion

Complex queries using JOIN, GROUP BY, CTE, ROW_NUMBER, WINDOW FUNCTIONS
